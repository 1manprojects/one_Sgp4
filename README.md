## Introduction

This library calculates the orbits of satellites via TLEs data from the web. Other functions for coordination transformation, time calculations and the calculation of contact windows depending on the observers coordinates on earth are also available. 

This library was created since I could not find a c# library with the necessary functions that I required. The calculations for the orbit propagations are based on the [SpaceTrack Report 3](https://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf). Other Calculations for Time and coordination transformations were taken from [Dr. T.S. Kelso website] (http://celestrak.com/columns/).
